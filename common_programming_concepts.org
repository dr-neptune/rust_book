* Common Programming Concepts

* Variables and Mutability

By default variables are immutable (awesome).
When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can't change that value.

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
#+END_SRC

Nets us:

error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --> src/main.rs:5:5
  |
3 |     let x = 5;
  |         -
  |         |
  |         first assignment to `x`
  |         help: make this binding mutable: `mut x`
4 |     println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
5 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0384`.

We can also force mutability by adding mut to the front of the variable name:

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
#+END_SRC

** Differences Between Variables and Constants

   Constants are immutable by default and you aren't allowed to use mut with constants.
   We can declare constants using the const keyword instead of the let keyword, and the type of the value must be annotated.
   They can be declared in any scope, even global scope.

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
#+END_SRC

** Shadowing

   As we saw in the guessing game, we can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, and the new variable shadows the previous variable.
   When the first variable is /shadowed/ by the second, the second variable's value is what is used when the variable is called.

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let x = x + 1;
    let x = x * 2;

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
#+END_SRC

Shadowing is different from marking a variable as mut because we'll get a compile time error is we accidentally try to reassign this variable without using the let keyword.
By using let, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.

The other difference between mut and shadowing is that because we're effectively creating a new variable when we use the let keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name.

For example, say our program asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by inputting space characters, but we really want to store that input as a number:

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    let spaces = "  ";
    let spaces = spaces.len();
    println!("Spaces: {}", spaces);
}
#+END_SRC

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    let mut spaces = "  ";
    let spaces = spaces.len();
    println!("Spaces: {}", spaces);
}
#+END_SRC

warning: variable does not need to be mutable
 --> src/main.rs:3:9
  |
3 |     let mut spaces = "  ";
  |         ----^^^^^^
  |         |

The book says we will get an error. I only got a warning.

* Data Types

In this section we will look at 2 data type subsets: scalar and compound.

In cases where many types are possible, such as when we converted a String to a numeric type using parse, we must add a type annotation like this:

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
    println!("{}", guess);
}
#+END_SRC

If we don't add the type annotation, it won't compile:

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    let guess = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
    println!("{}", guess);
}
#+END_SRC

error[E0282]: type annotations needed
 --> src/main.rs:3:9
  |
3 |     let guess = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
  |         ^^^^^ consider giving `guess` a type

** Scalar Types

   A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has 4 primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

   
** Integer Types

   An integer is a number without a fractional component.

   Here are the built in integer types for rust:

| Length  | Signed | Unsigned |
|---------+--------+----------|
| 16 bit  | i16    | u16      |
| 32 bit  | i32    | u32      |
| 64 bit  | i64    | u64      |
| 128 bit | i128   | u128     |
| arch    | isize  | usize    |

Signed and unsigned refer to whether it's possible for the number to be negative, i.e. whether it needs to have a sign (signed) or not (unsigned).

If you're unsure of which integer to use, Rust defaults to i32 which is generally the fastest (even on 64 bit systems).
The primary situation in which you'd use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection.

** Floating Point Types

   Rusts floating point types are f32 and f64. The default is f64.
   
#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64
    let y: f32 = 3.0; //f32
}
#+END_SRC

*** Numeric Operations

 #+name:
 #+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.3;

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;

    println!(
        "Sum:\t\t{}\nDifference:\t{}\nProduct:\t{}\nQuotient:\t{}\nRemainder:\t{}",
        sum, difference, product, quotient, remainder
    );
}
 #+END_SRC

*** The Boolean Type

 #+name:
 #+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;
    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
 #+END_SRC

*** The Character Type
   
 #+name:
 #+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z = 'â„¤';
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';

    println!("{}{}{}", c, z, heart_eyed_cat);
}
 #+END_SRC

** Compound Types

   Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

*** The Tuple Type

    A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
// create a tuple
fn main() {
    // create a tuple
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    // destructure the tuple
    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!(
        "The value of x is:\t{}\nThe value of y is:\t{}\nThe value of z is:\t{}",
        x, y, z
    );

    // access tuple elements directly using period
    let five_hundred = tup.0;
    let six_point_four = tup.1;
    let one = tup.2;
    println!(
        "Our tuple:\t\t({}, {}, {})",
        five_hundred, six_point_four, one
    );
}
#+END_SRC

*** The Array Type

    Arrays:
    Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type.
    Arrays in rust differ from arrays in some other languages because they have a fixed length, like tuples.
    Arrays are useful when we want our data allocated on the stack rather than on the heap, or when we want to ensure we always have a fixed number of elements.

    Vectors:
    A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is allowed to grow or shrink in size. If we are unsure whether to use an array or vector, we should probably use a vector.
    
#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    // define an array
    let _a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let _a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // explicit type declaration and length.
    let a = [3; 5]; // returns an array with 5 elements, all of which are 3.
                    // example of good vector use. no adding / deletion
    let months = [
        "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec",
    ];

    // accessing array elements
    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];

    for i in 0..a.len() {
        println!("Month:\t{}\nA:\t{}", months[i], a[i]);
        println!("First:\t{}\nSecond:\t{}", first * i, second * i);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

* Functions

In function signatures, you must declare the type of each parameter. Requiring type annotations in function definitions means that the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to figure out what you mean.

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn another_function(x: i32, y: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is:\t{}\nThe value of y is:\t{}", x, y);
}

fn main() {
    another_function(5, 6);
}
#+END_SRC

Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression.
Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
Expressions evaluate to a resulting value.

something like `let y = 6;` is a statement. A function definition is also a statement, i.e. `fn main() {let y = 6;}` is a statement.

statements do not return values so you can't do something like this: 

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
}
#+END_SRC

Expressions evaluate to something and make up most of the rest of the code that you'll be writing in Rust.

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    let _x = 5;
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };
    println!("The value of y is:\t{}", y);
}
#+END_SRC

** Functions with Return Values

   We don't name return values, but we do declare their type after an arrow (->).

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();
    println!("The value of x is:\t{}", x);
}
#+END_SRC

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
#+END_SRC

If we place a semi-colon at the end of the line containing x + 1, we change it from an expression to a statement, throwing an error:

#+name:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1;
}

fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
