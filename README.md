# The Rust Book Notes

This is me following along with a book club. 
We are working through [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)

Furthermore, for each 2 chapters we are trying to implement external projects.
Currently this repository includes:

Bloomfilter.org: 
[Let's Implement a Bloom Filter](https://onatm.dev/2020/08/10/let-s-implement-a-bloom-filter/)

browser_engine.org:
[Let's Build a Browser Engine!](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html)
